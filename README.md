# UltraFunGuns
An ULTRAKILL mod with fun weapons!... Well currently **only one**.

### Disclaimer
The mod is currently in VERY early development so more weapons will be released in time and the functionality of all of them will be improved upon greatly in the future.
In the meantime you can have some fun with the absolute hilariously buggy mess that is the first weapon.

## 1. Sonic Reverberator - Slot 7

______________________________________________________________________________________________
The Sonic Reverberator is a device built around a strange artifact which seems to hold an untold amount of energy.
After charging the device and exciting the artifact, this device is capable of unleashing a MASSIVE amount of energy in devastating shockwave.

However, it's best to be careful. Overcharging this weapon could have disasterous consequences and it will need to cool down for a while.

To use the weapon, hold **Primary Fire** to charge it and press **Secondary Fire** to release charged energy.

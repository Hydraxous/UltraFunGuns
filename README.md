# UltraFunGuns
An ULTRAKILL mod with fun weapons!!

### Disclaimer
The mod is currently in VERY early development so more weapons will be released in time and the functionality of all of them will be improved upon greatly in the future.
In the meantime you can have some fun with the absolute hilariously buggy mess that is this mod.

# Weapons
______________________________________________________________________________________________

## 1. Sonic Reverberator - Slot 7 - Kinetic weapon

______________________________________________________________________________________________
The Sonic Reverberator is a device built around a strange artifact which seems to hold an untold amount of energy.
After charging the device and exciting the artifact, this device is capable of unleashing a MASSIVE amount of energy in devastating shockwave.

However, it's best to be careful. Overcharging this weapon could have disasterous consequences and it will need to cool down for a while.

To use the weapon, hold **Primary Fire** to charge it and press **Secondary Fire** to release charged energy.

Planned changes:
- Total rework of knockback mechanic
- Fix to animations

## 2. EGG - Slot 8 - Thrown weapon

______________________________________________________________________________________________
The EGG in the correct hands can be absolutely devastating. Nobody understands where it came from, but it's here.
The EGG can be thrown or dropped below you. When the EGG is airborne, you can shoot it for an EGGSPLOSION which will hurl more EGG at nearby enemies.

To use the weapon, you can press **Primary Fire** to throw an egg and **Secondary Fire** to drop it below you without inheriting your speed.

Planned changes:
- Grapple EGG for small health boost
- EGGsplosion can be executed by railgun/revolver

## 3. Focalyzer - Slot 9 - Energy weapon

______________________________________________________________________________________________
The Focalyzer functions by focusing a weak laser beam into a specialized crystal which amplifies it's wavelength allowing it to deliver massive energy streams at vast distances. UNRELATED FUN FACT: The scientist who created it was apparently vaporized along with 12 others at a dance party shortly after the device's invention.

To use the weapon, you can hold **Primary Fire** to fire the laser. The laser can be used to damage enemies by itself. However, by pressing **Secondary Fire** you can dispense one of the six Pylons from the weapon. When a Pylon is charged with a Focalyzer beam it will refract the beam in random directions. If several Pylons are within range of each other the Pylons will refract the beam to eachother dealing damage over an area. 

Planned changes:
- Break pylons with punch
- Pull pylons towards player with grapple
